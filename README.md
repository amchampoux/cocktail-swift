# Cocktail Swift

This app was created for a learning purpose. I love cocktails and Ricardo... that was the perfect mix! But then I decided to add more sections to explore other Swift useful views. It became a cocktail of features. Built using XCode 14.0 (Swift 5.7). The layout was done using both autoLayout and Pinlayout. OpenWeather API was used to display current weather in various locations.

## Swift component explored

* List and grid creation with UITableView, UICollectionView and UICollectionViewFlowLayout
* Saving user data with UserDefaults
* Notify user with UIAlertController
* Map management with PinAnnotationView and MKMarkerAnnotationView, Geocoder
* Form creation with UITextField, UIPickerView, UISegmentedControl, UISwitch, UIStackView, UIStepper
